                <p>Savitri bai phule was an early female teacher in India , Indian social reformer ,Educationalist, and 
                    poet from Maharashtra . Along with her husband, Jyotiba phule in Maharashtra, she played a vital role in 
                    improving women's rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of india's feminist movement.
              <br>
              Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, 
              his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.Once she completed her primary education with Jyotirao,
               her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.[additional citation(s) needed]
               She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar,
                and the second course was at a Normal School in Poona (Now Pune). Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress
            <br>
            After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at Poona. She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar, sister of Jyotiba Phule[2] who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.[citation needed] Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide-wada. Bhidewada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that the trio was doing. The curriculum at Bhidewada included traditional western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies.

By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three schools had approximately one hundred and fifty students enrolled. Like the curriculum, the teaching methods employed by the three schools differed from those used in government schools. The author Divya Kandukuri believes that the Phule methods were regarded as being superior to those used by government schools. As a result of this reputation, the number of girls receiving their education at the Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys enrolled in government schools.
